# KoboGloHd

Create a .tgz with theese files.
Name it KoboRoot.tgz and put by usb cable in your Kobo Glo HD at .kobo/KoboRoot.tgz.


You will be able to execute scripts from images with fmon (see mnt/onboard/.kobo/fmon/).
You also will be able to telnet as root to your Kobo Glo HD (no password initially) and upload files through ftp.
A script update is able to update the Kobo Glo HD database after ftp uploads, it emulates the connection of a usb cable, click connect when it asks and wait a while to update the sqlite data with your new e-books.
You have to choose an image and put it into /mnt/onboard/update.png (see mnt/onboard/.kobo/fmon/update.sh)

Enjoy it ;)
